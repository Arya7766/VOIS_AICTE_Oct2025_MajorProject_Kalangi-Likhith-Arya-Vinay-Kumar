Project Overview
----------------
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook(s) and supporting material for the VOIS major project carried out for AICTE Oct 2025 by the team: Kalangi, Likhith, Arya, and Vinay Kumar.

The project focuses on (describe the problem area here — e.g., voice/speech processing, audio classification, speaker identification, or other domain-specific task). The notebooks contain data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization steps used in experiments.

Repository Structure
--------------------
- .ipynb files — primary notebooks containing code, analysis, experiments, and narrative.
- data/ (optional) — raw and processed datasets (if present; large files typically excluded from repo).
- notebooks/ (optional) — additional or split notebooks.
- requirements.txt — Python dependencies (create if not present).
- README.md — this file.

Notebooks
---------
Primary work is stored as Jupyter Notebook(s). Each notebook typically contains:
1. Problem statement and goals
2. Environment & dependencies
3. Data loading & EDA
4. Preprocessing & feature extraction
5. Model architecture and training
6. Evaluation metrics and results
7. Visualizations and analysis
8. Conclusions and next steps

Installation
------------
Recommended: create a virtual environment (conda or venv) and install dependencies.

Example using pip:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Arya7766/VOIS_AICTE_Oct2025_MajorProject_Kalangi-Likhith-Arya-Vinay-Kumar.git
2. Create virtual environment:
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  (or .\.venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)
3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

If requirements.txt is not present, typical packages to install:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- jupyterlab / notebook
- librosa (if audio / speech processing)
- tensorflow or torch (depending on model)

Usage
-----
Open the notebook(s) in Jupyter and run the cells in order. Example:
1. Start Jupyter:
   jupyter lab
2. Open the main notebook (e.g., main.ipynb) and run all cells.

If there are helper scripts for training or inference, run them as described in the notebook or add run commands below:
- Train: python train.py --config config.yml
- Inference: python infer.py --model-path path/to/model --input path/to/input

Notebook walkthrough (high-level)
---------------------------------
A typical notebook sections breakdown:
- Setup: imports, environment checks, version prints
- Load data: load CSVs / audio files, quick sanity checks
- EDA: visualizations of class distribution, durations, waveforms/spectrograms
- Preprocessing: resampling, normalization, feature extraction (MFCCs / mel-spectrograms)
- Data split: train / val / test splits (stratified if classification)
- Modeling: model definition (classical ML or deep learning), training loop, callbacks
- Evaluation: confusion matrix, accuracy, precision/recall/F1, ROC/AUC as applicable
- Results: sample predictions, visual artifacts, and analysis
- Conclusion & next steps

Data
----
If datasets are included, they will be located under a `data/` directory. If too large, data may be stored externally and a link provided inside the notebooks. Ensure you follow any dataset license or attribution requirements.

Model & Experiments
-------------------
The notebook documents model choices, hyperparameters, and training regimes. Look for sections labeled "Model" or "Experiments". To reproduce experiments, note:
- Random seeds used
- Train / validation splits
- Hyperparameter values
- Hardware used (CPU / GPU)

Results
-------
Key metrics, plots, and qualitative results are inside the notebooks. For easy sharing, export the final notebook to HTML (File → Export Notebook As → HTML) or convert via:
jupyter nbconvert --to html main.ipynb

Reproducibility
---------------
- Use the provided requirements.txt or environment.yml.
- Seed random number generators (numpy, random, frameworks) as shown in notebooks.
- Record exact dataset versions and splits.
- Use same preprocessing pipeline and model weights.

Contributing
------------
If you want to contribute:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch for your changes
3. Submit a pull request describing your changes and rationale

If you want me to add this README to the repo directly or create a PR, I can do that for you.

License
-------
Add a license file (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0) if you wish to publish the project. If you want, tell me which license to add and I will create the LICENSE file.

Notes
-----
- This README was generated without reading the actual notebook(s). I can produce a README that extracts exact descriptions, required packages, datasets, usage examples, and results directly from your .ipynb file. To do that, either:
  - Provide the notebook filename/path inside the repo, or
  - Upload/paste the .ipynb file content here, or
  - Allow me to read the repository so I can extract accurate sections (I will then update this README with precise content).
